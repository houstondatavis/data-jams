  description: "Since it's been freezing in houston recently, we thought it might be fun to have a dataset that takes stock of Houston's current mood. We pulled in data using twitter's api following the #houwx hashtag. Justin Gosses pulled the dataset, and Yulan Lin worked on munging it. The csv contains a lot less information than the raw json dump from the api, but is more structured. The 'long' tweets do not exist in the json in this repository"
