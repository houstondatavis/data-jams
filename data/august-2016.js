  description: "The data includes US primary election results from 2016 and demographics by county.\n\
  Vote data included variables like `Vote_count` per candidate. County data included age and racial \
  breakdown, educational attainment, employment etc., as well as shapefiles for the counties.\n\
  Data were sourced from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election)\n\
  and were enriched with primary schedule, and primary type (open, closed, etc.) during the data jam."
